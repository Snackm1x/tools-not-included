# Changelog
### 27 January 2019
* 'Reset all rules' now correctly resets also seed number  

For seeds collected since 7th Jan:
* Added a world and geyser visual map 
* Added world element composition - total masses in starting biome and all biomes
* Added biome size list


### 12 January 2019
* Added an 'exactly' rule comparator for planet and geyser counts rules
* Brought back the possibility to reset all rules at once
* Ability to import/export rules using a generated code
* Minor styling changes

### 8 January 2019
* Hotfix for mods addressing issue that was preventing connection.

### 7 January 2019
Out of beta! Yay! Due to world element composition being collected, worlds uploaded need to be fresh - within 60 seconds of creation and with no cells dug. If your seed turns out to be great mid-game, you can still create a fresh world with that seed and upload it!
* The entire front-end rewritten
* The seed browser filter has been expanded with a custom rule builder
* Seed details page shows a star map
* Various performance improvements

From now on, two mods will be maintained: manual and automatic. Automatic version (aka the seed miner - not suitable for playing, seed uploading only) works in background and automatically generates and uploads new worlds without interaction. For more information please refer to the [Mod Info Page](https://toolsnotincluded.net/seeds/modinfo)
* Mod versions 1.0a(utomatic) and 1.0m(anual):
  * Mods do not require debug mode anymore
  * Collecting data about world element composition
* Mod version 1.0m:
  * Constraint: uploaded worlds need to be within 60 seconds of their creation and with no cells dug out.
