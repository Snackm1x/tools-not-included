# Tools Not Included
Tools Not Included (https://toolsnotincluded.net) is a website with tools for the game [Oxygen Not Included](https://klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included) by Klei.
Currently it features a [Seed Browser](#tools-not-included-seed-browser) but will be expanded with more tools in the future.

## [Seed Browser](https://toolsnotincluded.net/seeds)
The Seed Browser is a place for people to browse and share game world seeds. The seeds can be filtered by a set of rules: combination of counts of geysers, planets or geyser outputs.  
The seeds can be uploaded to the database using the [dedicated mods](https://toolsnotincluded.net/seeds/modinfo)

### Current mod versions
